title: Next step - Costmaps for Navigation
---

As we already have ```map``` and ```odometry``` data from the robot, as well as we can publish ```goal pose``` data, global navigation algorithms can be used to generate a path to reach the goal. The first step is to generate a proper costmaps for it.

A costmap is a map that represents places that are safe for the robot in a grid of cells. Each cell in costmap can take values in range (0, 255). Here are some special values:

* 255 - No information
* 254 - Lethal obstacle, obstacle in that cell
* 253 - Inscribed inflated obstacle. No obstacle there, but movement of robot center will cause collision here
* 0 - Free space, no obstacle

There are two types of costmaps, ```global costmap``` and ```local costmap```. The difference is that global is generated from map, while local one is based on sensor data

Right now I am trying to construct a global costmap. As the global_costmap relies only on the data from map, and robot dimensions, it already can be generated.

Currently, I am using ```NavfnROs``` planner, and tuning the variables.
