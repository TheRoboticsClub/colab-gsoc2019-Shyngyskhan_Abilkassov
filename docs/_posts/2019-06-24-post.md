## Navigation stack and move_base for Amazon Robot

Now the robot can safely navigate to any point sent in RViz tool through ```2D NavGoal``` button, pick-up the palette, and continue movement to any other point. Robot dimensions, laser distance all configured properly in costmaps. The pick-up logic is currently maintained through the GUI button. The demo is below:

Currently, movement with a palette on a robot is restricted and should be supervised as the dimensions of a palette are not taken into account of the costmaps. Sometimes it bumps into obstacles. This problem and a pick-up logic still need to be solved.
