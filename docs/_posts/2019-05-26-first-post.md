title: About me and my project
---

**In this post I'll introduce myself and tell about the project I'm going to work this summer.**

## About me and my motivation

My name is Shyngyskhan and I'm from Astana, Kazakhstan. I'm majoring in Robotics and Mechatronics and that's one of the reasons why I applied and contributed to the Robotics Academy. I myself stuggled a lot to learn the applications of ROS and OpenCV, and that's why I think Robotics Academy is making a great job at sharing knowledge to aspiring Robotics and Computer Vision engineers.

## About my project

This summer I'll be working on creation of Amazon Warehouse robots exercise for students to learn more about OMPL, ROS, and robot control. This exercise was inspired by these wonderful tiny workers:

Last summer, Arsalan had already [started](https://jderobot.org/Club-aakhter) this exercise, where he made robot and world models in Gazebo as well as some basic control functionality. My primary aim here is to finish it, and integrate it into Robotics Academy repository.
