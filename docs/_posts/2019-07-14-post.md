title: Separate thread for Actionlib client (move_base)

## Tried and tested creating separate thread for goal sending

As I mentioned previously, one of the main issues I am currently stuck with is that after sending a goal to a client there are several problems of monitoring it. In the beginning I have tried method ```wait_for_result``` but the problem is that this method pauses whole ```MyAlgorithm``` thread and everything got stuck. The second idea was to implement separate thread that can keep track of goals. I created a separate ```threadGoalSender``` class which takes main functionality and is similar to ```ThreadPublisher```, which in its own thread continuously sends/publishes goals/messages. It works fine with ```ROS``` messages, but as I found out it doesn't work with Actionlib client instance which sends goals to ```move_base``` package. As I understood, each time it receives new goal it starts to re-build it path and calculate costmaps, and this is why jerky motion is taking place. This behaviour is shown in the following video:

For now, I removed this separate thread and will try to solve the problem without it.
