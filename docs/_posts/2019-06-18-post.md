title: GUI Update
---

During our last meeting, Carlos suggested to update the GUI of the exercise and in particular the ```MapWidget```. The problem is that currently user can select any point on map to mark as a destination for a robot. However, it would be better if marker can be approximated to the palette on warehouse or select any point on special regions like charging and pick-up regions.

I have created a separate yaml file which holds all the locations of palletes that are in the "gray" region, which is then traversed by a separate method, which then approximates selected point to the center of the closest pallete. This should help robot to make a better positioning under palette before pick up. Additionally, separate zones for chargin and pick-up were left for free destination selection.

All work was done on ```gui_pallette``` branch and was successfully merged. The implementation of this task can be seen in a video below:

## Solution progress

I am still stuck with configuration of the AMCL node for a robot. I have created a [question](http://answers.ros.org/question/289584/what-is-the-position-topic-i-should-give-move-base-when-amcl-is-not-used/) in ROS Answers, and hope that someone can help me to work this problem out.
